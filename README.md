# A-CURE

The A-CURE project seeks to investigate the perturbation of various parameters and how these perturbations affect the running of the UM/ESM

## Deliverable

A set of rose suites and a branch of the UKESM or UM which allows ensembles to be run

## Tasks

Tasks to produce the deliverable will include:

### Preliminary test
* Create a branch of the UKESM which contains a single new variable in the UKCA section
* Implement some science behind this new variable
* Create an ensemble rose suite which can perturb the variable

### Full system
* As above but with a full set of 33 variables, some of which are new, others of which are already in the UKCA module, and some which would replace existing variables and give new, slightly modified, behaviour

## Resources

Currently, various resources have been used. Among these are:

* The UKCA tutorials which instruct on the addition of variables to the UKCA section of the UM
* An ensemble rose suite which could be repurposed
