help=The Analysis Correction (AC) Scheme is the method by which observational
    =information is incrementally applied over a period of time to produce an
    =analysis. The process starts with a model background from a previous run of
    =the model. The information from each observation is applied with a triangular
    =weighting function,
    =typically with a long insertion period before validity
    =time,
    =and a shorter influence after.
    =For most observation types,
    =data assimilation is performed by the IAU in
    =conjuntion with the Variational Assimilation system.
    =The AC scheme is used only for the assimilation of MOPS data in the mesoscale
    =model,
    =and Tropical Convective Rainfall (TCR) in the global model.
    =For further documentation of the AC scheme,
    =refer to UMDP 30 (for scientific
    =aspects),
    =and UMDP P3 (for technical aspects). (Note - these papers can be
    =found under http://www-nwp/umdoc/Old_UMDP).
    =The period of time over which the AC scheme is used is controlled by

    =The "Start of AC" would normally be the start of the run (i.e 0).
    =The "End of AC" depends on both the time-window and the definition of

    =reference time to the date of the original NRUN.
    =
    =Climate model users are advised to set a true date. Such users
    =who are generally doing long integrations will almost certainly
    =be using updating of ancillary fields. So setting a true date

    =required:
    =
    =Using the items namelist the user can specify a period
    =of updating for ancillary fields. This is not enough to define
    =the actual point of updating. If the ancil reference time is
    =set to the basis/start time the first point of updating was
    =always the beginning of a new run, and subsequent updates

    =would mean that if the run were restarted as an NRUN at a
    =time that was not an updating point of the original run, the
    =updating points of the new run would be different and the
    =results would therefore not bit compare with the original run.
    =
    =The following explains this further. The data in the ancillary

    =is in use from 0 <= day < 5.
    =
    =Clearly, a similar new run starting from a dump at day 3
    =will use different dates for the updating and base them on
    =different time-interpolation days. Time interpolation used
    =would be day 5.5 and the ancillary field would be in use
    =from 3 <= day < 8. This will not give the same result as

    =(a) Vertical structure of convective cloud water is
    =maintained. Radiation originally constructed a CCW profile by
    =uniformly distributing the CCLWP from cloud base to cloud
    =top. This resulted in a loss of vertical structure and limited
    =the convection/radiation schemes to one contigious cloud per
    =gridpoint/per timestep. CCRad allows the use of either method
    =(see "Use 3D convective cloud water from convection scheme" in
    =SW & LW Radiation/Cloud)
    =
    =(b) CCA 2D is currently based on Total Condensed Water(TCW). Though
    =this assumes that there is only one contigious cloud in the
    =vertical per gridbox. However, mid-level cloud is allowed on
    =the same timestep and gridbox as shallow or deep convection. by
    =using a 2D field such as TCW, lower cloud (shallow, deep) is able
    =to affect the CCA of higher cloud(mid-level). CCRad decouples
    =mid-level convection from shallow and deep by using TCW from the

    =>From UM 5.0 onwards the basic dynamics of the model no longer
    =conserves dry energy. Prior to UM 5.0 the old Eulerian dynamics of the
    =model could have been coded to conserve energy. (In practice this was
    =not the case.)
    =
    =Even if the dynamics of the model conserves energy the UM lacks a
    =physical parametrization for frictional heating and therefore the
    =model will not conserve energy. The missing energy is corrected for by
    =including an energy correction in the form of a uniform increment to
    =temperature,
    =of the form Cv(dT/dt).
    =
    =The energy adjustment works by evaluating the total energy of the
    =model at the beginning of a model run and then again at the end of the
    =period specified by the user. Prior to UM 5.1 this period should
    =always have been set to 24 hours to work correctly. Now,
    =the period
    =can take any value which is a multiple of the radiation
    =timestep. During the period the energy fluxes into the atmosphere from
    =the physical parametrization which include radiation are
    =accumulated. At the end of each period the sum of the change in energy
    =due to parametrizations is compared to the total change in energy. The
    =difference is the error and is used to work out the correction
    =required for the next period.

help=Using timeseries to investigate model behaviour.
    =-------------------------------------------------
    =
    =UM timeseries can provide a useful means of looking at the behaviour
    =of the model at selected locations. This is best done by selecting a
    =small number of grid points of interest (eg because the behaviour of
    =the model with two different physics parametrisations changes at these
    =locations).  The next step is to decide which output fields are of
    =interest.  In this type of investigation it is usually useful to get
    =out timeseries with a time profile of every timestep. Fields of
    =interest would often include top of atmosphere radiation,
    =surface radiation,surface latent heat,surface sensible heat,
    =precipitation,surface temperature & or 1.5m temperature,
    =boundary layer depth. In many studies it will also be useful to
    =get out T,
    =q,qcl,qcf,layer cloud,
    =convective cloud on all model levels for the selected grid
    =points. These fields can then be plotted as model level versus time
    =sections and will show what is happening in the model.  U & V can also
    =be output but because of the grid on which u and v are held ie offset
    =by 1/2 grid length from T,
    =q grid they will not be at the same
    =locations.
    =
    =In most studies of this type a short run of 1-3 months outputting
    =timeseries is usually enough. Note that including timeseries increases
    =the memory requirements of the run. If a lot of points and fields are
    =requested every timestep the memory required will quickly exceed that
    =required in normal climate runs. It may be necessary to reinitialise
    =the timeseries on periods of less than 30 days.
    =
    =Setting up timeseries requests
    =------------------------------
    =
    =STASH time series are defined by both domain and time profiles.
    =
    =The facility allows you to specify a number of "boxes",
    =these get collapsed
    =down to point values by meaning (using any weighting defined in the domain
    =profile).
    =
    =This list of point values is written to an area of memory at intervals defined
    =by the sampling frequency in the time profile.
    =
    =The time profile also defines an over-writing period to stop the list becoming
    =too long. It is normal to output the result at the same frequency as the
    =over-writing period.
    =
    =eg.
    =days                            0           1           2           3
    =timesteps                       .............................................
    =sampling freq 12hrs                   |     |     |     |     |     |
    =over-writing freq 24hrs                     x           x           x
    =output freq 24hrs                           +           +           +
    =
    =would result in a "PP-fields" each with 2 time levels and as many points as
    =are defined in the domain profile. The "fields" would be produced each day.
    =If 3 "points" were defined,
    =the file would contain "fields" vis:
    =
    =Field 1.  VAL(point=1,
    =time=12),VAL(point=2,time=12),VAL(point=3,time=12),
    =VAL(point=1,time=24),VAL(point=2,time=24),VAL(point=3,
    =time=24)
    =Field 2.  VAL(point=1,time=36),VAL(point=2,
    =time=36),VAL(point=3,time=36),VAL(point=1,time=48),

    =time=48)
    =etc.
    =
    =
    =This panel allows two methods of specifying boxes. In the first
    =method,
    =a box is specified by giving the range of points it contains
    =in both horizontal directions and the number of levels it
    =contains. Thus,
    =each line of the table describes a single box.
    =
    =The second method is used for specifying boxes of a single grid point
    =on one level. In this method,
    =a range of levels indicates one box for
    =each level. This method is quicker to set up when you want to look at
    =the same point separately on a number of levels.
    =
    =To compare the methods,
    =if you wanted to look at point 3,5 on levels
    =4,
    =5 and 6 then in the first method you would have 3 rows:
    =
    =3  3  5  5  4
    =3  3  5  5  5
    =3  3  5  5  6
    =
    =whereas in the second method you would require one row:
    =
    =3  5  4  6
    =
    =When specifying boxes of more than one gridpoint it may be that some
    =of the dimensions of the boxes may be collapsed out by other
    =attributes of the domain profile. For example,
    =doing a vertical mean
    =on the previous window will mean that a timeseries on more than one
    =level is not relevant. In such cases,
    =the unused columns in the table
    =are disabled.
    =
    =Only the atmospheric model allows true boxes at present. Other models can
    =only deal with points,
    =so specify the "first" and "last" dimensions as
    =the same,
    =or use the second method of specifying timeseries.
    =
    =It is normal to specify the full horizontal domain in the HORIZONTAL window of
    =a time series profile. Spatial averaging is not normally required.
    =
    =All dimensions must lie within the box defined by the rest of the profile.
    =
    =Special PP-package programs are required to access time-series.

help=Numerous UM output filename entries support special control
    =sequences which will be expanded prior to creating the file based
    =on the current time state of the model.
    =
    =The available special characters are:
    =
    =  * Absolute time components (%Y, %m, %d, %H, %M, %S)
    =    The exact date/time of the model at the point where the
    =    filename is generated.
    =
    =  * Analysis time components (%AY, %Am, %Ad, %AH, %AM, %AS)
    =    The exact date/time of the model analysis (if no analysis is
    =    being used, this will be the start date/time of the run).
    =
    =  * Relative time components (%QY, %Qm, %Qd, %QH, %QM, %QS)
    =    The time into the model run relative to the analysis time (or
    =    start of run if no analysis is in use).  Each unit is rounded
    =    down, so if using these make sure the lowest expected unit is
    =    included to avoid naming clashes.  Supports padding (see below).
    =
    =  * Relative total times (%RY, %Rm, %Rd, %RH, %RM, %RS)
    =    The total time into the model run relative to the analysis time
    =    (or start of run if no analysis is in use) in each unit.  Unlike
    =    the above "Q" versions these are equivalent to each other;
    =    i.e. if the model has run for 2 days, %RD = 02, %RH = 48,
    =    %RM = 2880 (whereas %QD = 02, %QH = 00, %QM = 00)
    =
    =  * Month or season names (%b, %s)
    =    The name of the current month, or the name of the season which
    =    starts in the current month.  Using 3 characters (e.g. jan, feb
    =    mar... dec or djf, jfm, fma... ond).
    =
    =  * Timestep (%T)
    =    The exact number of the current timestep.
    =
    =  * Analysis position indicator (%+)
    =    Either a plus or minus sign, depending on whether the model has
    =    reached the analysis time (if using an analysis).
    =
    =  * Literal percentage (%%)
    =    An actual percentage character, if required.
    =
    =The amount of zero-padding can be overridden for the %R and %Q
    =control sequences by including a number between the first and
    =second letters, e.g. %R3H or %Q6S.  Note that if for any reason the
    =value cannot fit into the provided amount of padding, the value will
    =be ignored and the entry in the filename expanded to fit the value
    =exactly (i.e. no padding).
    =
    =To support the UM naming conventions prior to UM 10.1 several legacy
    =options are also provided.  These will allow a filename to reproduce
    =exactly the old behaviour:
    =
    =  * Legacy-style relative hours (%N)
    =    This expands to a 3-character string giving the hours relative
    =    to the analysis time (or start of run).  To support hours up to
    =    3599 in this width the first character uses letters after the
    =    999th hour (so a00 = 1000 hours ... z99 = 3599 hours).  It is
    =    recommended to use the non-legacy form "%R3H" to replace this.
    =
    =  * Legacy-style sub-hourly (%n)
    =    This expands to a 4-character string giving the hours and minutes
    =    relative to the analysis (or start of run).  As with the %N form
    =    above this supports up to 359 hours and 59 seconds by using letters
    =    (so a000 = 100 hours ... z959 = 359 hours 59 minutes).  It is
    =    recommended to use the non-legacy form "%R2H%Q2M" to replace this.
    =
    =  * Legacy-style analysis position letter (%z)
    =    This is similar to %+ above, but instead of expanding to be a
    =    plus or minus sign it expands to a "z" or an "a", which was used
    =    in older dump files as the indicator.
    =
    =  * Legacy-style absolute (%C)
    =    This expands to a variety of possible strings.
    =
    =    For most dumps or normal output stream files it resembles either
    =    "%Y%m%d" or "%Y%m%d_%H" (depending on if the output frequency is
    =    more or less frequent than 1-day, though dumps never have the "%H"
    =    part).  It is recommended to use on of the above forms to replace
    =    this for these cases.
    =
    =    For climate meaning files it expands to a pre-determined name
    =    depending on the periodicity of the meaning.  There are too many
    =    possibilities to cover here but as a few examples:
    =       %C => "m%Y%b"   (monthly means)
    =       %C => "s%Y%s"   (seasonal means)
    =       %C => "w%Y%m%d" (weekly means)
    =       %C => "x%Y%m%d" (10 yearly means)
    =       %C => "1%Y%m%d_%H" (unknown mean for period 1)
    =       %C => "2%Y%m%d_%H" (unknown mean for period 2)
    =
    =    Note also that using the above option files will be named using
    =    the date/time at the *end* of the meaning period (not the start),
    =    *except* for the monthly and seasonal means - which will be
    =    labelled using the start of the mean period.  It is recommended
    =    to replace the "%C" indicator with a suitable form such as those
    =    above, based on knowledge of the periodicity.
